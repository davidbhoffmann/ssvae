\textbf{Accuracy and ELBO Results}: 
\begin{itemize} 
        \item Test accuracy stable up to $\approx$20\% corruption for MNIST digit label.
        \item As corruption increases, accuracy drops below random chance (10\%).
        \item ELBO drops slightly with increasing corruption, but overall remains stable.
    \end{itemize}

\textbf{Effect on Disentanglement Scores}: 
\begin{itemize} 
        \item Disentanglement is higher for smaller supervised set sizes.
        \item Further, scores increase with label corruption. More pronounced for larger supervised set sizes.
        \item Indicates that supervision harms disentanglement of the style latent $z$.
    \end{itemize}
